Under ubuntu, make sure you have installed the packages:

    sudo apt-get install qt4-dev libqt4-qt3support

Then run

    qmake-qt4
    make

That should build the binary (kseg) in the current directory.

Old instructions:

Building KSEG should be simple.

Be sure you have Qt 4.x installed.  At the command line in the
directory where you untarred kseg, run "qmake" (which creates
the Makefile) and then "make".

In order for help to work, the help file, kseg_help_en.html,
must be in the same directory as the language files (*.qm)

Good luck!
